	Ø It is a mindset and a way of working where dev and ops teams work together instead of working separately.
	Ø It focuses on collaboration, automation and continuous improvement to deliver software faster, more reliable and with high quality.


Principles of DevOps
=================
	1. Collaboration & Communication :- dev & ops teams break silos , everyone has to share responsibility for the app, frequent discussions instead of blame-game.
	2. Automation:- automate everything --> Build, test, deployment, monitoring and infrastructure (iac), automation reduces errors and speeds up delivery
	3. Continuous everything :
 =======================

	Ø Continuous integration(CI):- developers merge code frequently 
	Ø Continuous deploy and deliver (CD):- deploy automatically to env
	Ø Continuous monitoring:- monitor app logs, metrics and alerts .

	4. Ownership & Accountability:- developers also think about "how will it run in production 
	5. Customer-centric mindset:- deliver features quickly, improve based on feedback, focus in on user experience but not internal departments.
	6. Fail fast, learn fast:- small experiments, accept failures and learn quickly and improve
	7. Data-driven decisions:- using metrics to improve --> deployment frequency, lead time, meant time to recovery and production failure

Version control systems (VCS)
=========================

	Ø It us used to track changes in code
	Ø It remembers every change you make 
	Ø You can go back to any previous version 
	Ø Many people can work on the same project without conflicts
